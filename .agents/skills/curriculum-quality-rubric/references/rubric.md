# Unit Quality Rubric

Use this to score each dimension from 0 to 5.

## 1) Pedagogy And Clarity
- `0`: Unstructured text dump.
- `1`: Basic headings only, weak progression.
- `2`: Some progression, unclear learning outcomes.
- `3`: Clear outcomes and flow, moderate instructional guidance.
- `4`: Strong scaffolding, clear transitions, concrete learner prompts.
- `5`: Excellent instructional design with explicit progression and support.

## 2) Activity Richness And Interaction Density
- `0`: No interaction.
- `1`: One passive interaction type only.
- `2`: Limited interaction variety, low learner input.
- `3`: Multiple interaction types with meaningful prompts.
- `4`: High interaction density with varied activity mechanics.
- `5`: Rich, balanced activities that drive active decision-making.

## 3) Assessment Quality And Feedback Loops
- `0`: No checks for understanding.
- `1`: Minimal reflection, no completion criteria.
- `2`: Basic checks, weak alignment to objectives.
- `3`: Adequate formative checks and end task.
- `4`: Strong alignment and explicit criteria for success.
- `5`: High-quality formative and summative assessment design with revision loops.

## 4) Accessibility And Readability
- `0`: Major accessibility blockers.
- `1`: Hard to read; poor structure.
- `2`: Some accessible patterns but inconsistent.
- `3`: Generally readable and navigable.
- `4`: Strong semantic structure and clear, readable UI.
- `5`: Excellent inclusive design and accessibility readiness.

## 5) Production Safety (SCORM/Brightspace/Offline)
- `0`: Build or validation fails.
- `1`: Frequent compliance risks.
- `2`: Some compliance issues unresolved.
- `3`: Passes guardrails with minor operational risk.
- `4`: Reliable and compliant output.
- `5`: Robust, repeatable, and fully compliant output.

## 6) Visual Hierarchy And UI Quality
- `0`: Visually broken.
- `1`: Flat/basic interface with poor hierarchy.
- `2`: Some hierarchy but generic and weak.
