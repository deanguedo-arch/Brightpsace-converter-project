### Why Focus Slips

Most focus drops happen when attention splits across too many competing signals.

## Build Your Reset

Use a short reset loop:

1. Name the distraction.
2. Breathe once with intention.
3. Anchor attention to your next action.

:::example
Example: "I noticed the noise, one deep breath, eyes on the first movement."
:::

:::accordion
- Cue 1: Choose a phrase that brings attention back to the present.
- Cue 2: Pick one physical anchor like posture, breath, or grip.
- Cue 3: Decide the first action after reset.

## Apply It

Write your own pre-performance checklist and test it with one short repetition.

:::warning
Do not over-design your routine. Keep it simple enough to execute under stress.
