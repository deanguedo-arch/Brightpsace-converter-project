### Essential Question

How do informed personal choices protect your wellbeing now and strengthen your future options?

## Part 1: Self-Knowledge Inventory

Personal choices improve when you understand your own patterns first.

### Checkpoint: What Works for Me

Use the prompts below as a live self-audit. Capture your answers in your notebook, assignment sheet, or LMS submission.

:::accordion
- Sleep and recovery: How much sleep do you need to stay focused and emotionally steady?
- Energy and nutrition: What foods and timing patterns keep your energy stable through the school day?
- Peak focus window: What time of day are you at your best, and what usually drains that focus?
- Learning tools: Do you work better with paper, typing, visuals, spoken instruction, or examples?
- Attention design: Do devices and music improve your focus or split your attention?
- Classroom setup: Which seat, text style, and pacing help you learn fastest?
- Goal ownership: Do you perform better with self-set goals, teacher-set goals, or a blend of both?
:::

### Learning Supports

From the original inventory, rate or reflect on which directions help you most:

1. Teacher explains out loud.
2. Teacher models an example.
3. Written directions are provided.
4. You try independently, then verify.
5. You compare process/results with a peer.

:::example
Micro-practice: Choose one strategy to test this week. Keep it if it works, replace it if it does not.
:::

## Part 2: Goal Design Lab

The source module uses a clear goal model: your goal must be **specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timed**.

### Build a Goal Statement

Use this sentence frame:

`(Who) + (How) + (What) + (When)`

| Prompt | Your Draft |
| --- | --- |
| Who is responsible? | |
| How will you do it? | |
| What exactly will be completed? | |
| When is the deadline? | |

:::accordion
- Measure: What evidence proves success (something you can see, hear, count, or verify)?
- Attainable: Is this mostly under your control?
- Realistic: Is the challenge level ambitious but believable?
- Timed: Is there a clear deadline or milestone date?
- Revision loop: If one answer is "no", rewrite the goal until all are "yes".
:::

### Reflection Prompts

1. Why is goal setting important for young adults?
2. What obstacles could interfere with your goal?
3. What support or habit would make completion more likely?

## Part 3: Relationship Literacy

Relationships in adolescence and adulthood are complex. Healthy relationships grow through communication, trust, boundaries, and respect.

### Relationship Progression Activity

The original workbook includes 16 relationship steps. Instead of one "correct order," think in clusters:

1. Initial connection:
   eye contact, flirting, basic conversation, messaging.
2. Trust and emotional closeness:
   sharing, consistency, care, non-sexual intimacy.
3. Commitment and responsibility:
   exclusivity, long-term planning, clear boundaries, consent.
4. Physical/sexual choices:
   should only happen when communication, consent, and protection are established.

:::warning
Healthy relationships require mutual consent, respect, and safety. Pressure, control, fear, or secrecy are warning signs.
:::

### Healthy vs Unhealthy Relationship Signals

| Healthy Signals | Unhealthy Signals |
| --- | --- |
| Honest communication | Manipulation or guilt pressure |
| Trust and privacy respect | Monitoring, jealousy, control |
| Shared decision-making | One-sided power |
| Emotional safety | Fear, shame, intimidation |
| Boundary respect | Repeated boundary violations |

:::accordion
- Debrief 1: What part of relationship progression felt easiest to reason through?
- Debrief 2: What part felt most difficult, and why?
- Debrief 3: Where do your ideas of "normal relationships" come from?
- Debrief 4: What can happen when a relationship progresses in an unhealthy way?
:::

## Part 4: Substance Awareness

This section combines alcohol and tobacco awareness from the source module.

### Alcohol Decision Matrix

| Choice | Possible Positives | Possible Negatives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not drinking | Clear judgment, legal safety, better control | Social pressure in some settings |
| Drinking moderately | Temporary social ease for some people | Impaired judgment, health/legal risk |
| Drinking too much | Short-term "escape" feeling | Injury, regret, conflict, dependence risk |

Ask yourself:

1. Why do people drink in social settings?
2. What would you say if offered a drink?
3. Who are two trusted resources you could ask for support?

### Tobacco Awareness

Nicotine is addictive. Quitting is difficult but possible with support and a plan.

:::accordion
- Why people start: Curiosity, social influence, stress coping, or identity signaling.
- Why it escalates: Tolerance builds, and occasional use can become routine dependence.
- Refusal script: "No thanks, that is not for me." plus change topic and move away from pressure.
- Support option from source material: Smokers' Helpline 1-866-332-2322.
:::

## Part 5: Risk Intelligence

Risk is part of life. The key skill is separating **healthy calculated risk** from **unhealthy avoidable risk**.

### Healthy Risk vs Unhealthy Risk

| Healthy Risk | Unhealthy Risk |
| --- | --- |
| Has growth value | Has low upside and high harm potential |
| Informed and planned | Impulsive or peer-pressure driven |
| Safety controls are used | Safety controls are ignored |
| Builds skill or confidence | Damages health, trust, or future options |

### Scenario Drill (From Source Themes)

Rate each as low, medium, or high risk based on context:

1. Performing in front of a crowd.
2. Driving over the speed limit.
3. Trying cannabis at a party.
4. Drinking before more drinking.
5. Sharing needles.
6. Occasional smoking that could become daily use.

:::example
Risk filter: What is the upside, what is the worst-case cost, and what is one safer alternative?
:::

## Part 6: Addiction Continuum

The workbook presents addiction as a progression, not a single event.

### Continuum Overview

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| No Use | No involvement with substances/gambling. |
| Use | Experimental or social exposure. |
| Misuse | Harm begins (regret, school/family problems, poor decisions). |
| Abuse | Problems become regular and affect major life areas. |
| Dependency | Loss of control, ongoing use despite consequences, cravings/withdrawal. |

### Scenario Analysis

Classify each scenario to a likely stage and justify your reasoning:

1. Rachel drinks heavily every day and struggles to sleep without alcohol.
2. Antoine refuses cigarettes after losing a parent to lung cancer.
3. Bailey craves cigarettes and steals one when she cannot access her own.

:::accordion
- Lens for Rachel: Daily heavy use, consequences ignored, and sleep reliance suggest dependency.
- Lens for Antoine: Clear refusal and no use aligns with no use.
- Lens for Bailey: Strong cravings and compulsive behavior suggest dependency risk.

## Part 7: Mental Health Awareness

The original module emphasizes that depression and emotional distress are real, common, and treatable with support.

### Common Warning Signs (Teen Context)

1. Persistent sadness, irritability, or anger.
2. Loss of interest in usual activities.
3. Sleep or appetite changes.
4. Concentration drop and falling school performance.
5. Hopeless thinking or talk about death/self-harm.

### Protective Habits

1. Stay connected to supportive people.
2. Keep body routines stable (sleep, movement, nutrition).
3. Avoid using alcohol or drugs to cope.
4. Ask for trusted adult/professional support early.

:::accordion
- If you are struggling: Talk to a trusted adult, counselor, or health professional as soon as possible.
- If a friend is struggling: Listen, take concerns seriously, and help connect them to support.
- If stress is overwhelming: Break tasks into small steps and ask for academic support promptly.
:::

:::warning
If someone talks about suicide or self-harm, treat it as urgent and involve a trusted adult or emergency support immediately.
:::

## Summative Task Studio

For the module summative, choose one of two pathways from the source packet.

### Option A: Life Map

Build a visual map of your life journey to date.

1. Start at birth and move chronologically.
2. Include at least 10 significant events.
3. Show transitions between events and what helped you adapt.
4. Include dates, places, symbols, and explanations.
5. Reflect on your proudest accomplishment, biggest obstacle, and strategies used.

### Option B: Inside Out Film Study

Analyze emotions and decision-making while watching *Inside Out*.

1. Dominant emotions.
2. Transition experiences.
3. Core memories and personality.
4. Mood effects on memory.
5. Social expectations around emotional expression.
6. Why sadness and other emotions matter.

:::example
